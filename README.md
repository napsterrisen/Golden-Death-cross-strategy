# Golden-cross-Death-cross
A golden cross suggests a long-term bull market going forward, while a death cross suggests a long-term bear market.

There is some variation of opinion as to precisely what constitutes this meaningful moving average crossover. Some analysts define it as a crossover of the 100-day moving average by the 50-day moving average; others define it as the crossover of the 200-day average by the 50-day average.


## Implementation:

NOTE: I have taken a crossover of 100 day MA by 20 day MA in consideration.
